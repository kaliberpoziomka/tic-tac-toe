# tic-tac-toe

The goal of this project was to make a Tic Tac Toe game.

Check how it works [here](https://kaliberpoziomka.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

### What I used in the project:
- html
- css, sass
- JavaScript, jQuery
- Design Patterns: Revaling Module, PubSub (Mediator)

In this project I learned how to use design patterns. 
I really liked PubSub, it's amazing how easy and helpful is the decoupling is with this design pattern.
I also managed to use jQuery and really liked how easy manipulating DOM with this library is.
I put DOM manipulation code in one module and game logic in another, so there is virtually no global variables or functions.
